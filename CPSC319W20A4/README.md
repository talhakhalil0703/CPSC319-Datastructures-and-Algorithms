**CPSC319W20A4.java** is my main class and should be executed, after compiling with the "Makefile", with one argument which is the file name

I have also added the javadocs which explain what each function does. Running this code will create 3 text files, which are the GRAPH, DFT, and MST in the same directory as the data file
