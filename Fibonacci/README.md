**Fibonacci.java** is my main class and should be executed, after compiling with the "Makefile", with no arguments

I have also added the javadocs which explain what each function does. I also have my testing code in this file. Running this code will create 3 text files, which are csvs when opened with excel and contain the data needed for the plotting. As in the first row is n, and the second row is the time it took to execute n.
